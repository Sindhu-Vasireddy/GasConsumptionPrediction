## Model Comparison

The following table summarizes the key details of the five models used for predicting gas consumption:

| Model                                | Features                        | Evaluation Metrics       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| LSTM (temp+GCVsGC)                   | Temperature, Gas Consumption    | R2, MSE, MAE               |
| LSTM (GC Autoregressive)              | Gas Consumption (Autoregressive)|     MSE                   |
| RandomForestRegressor                | Temperature, Gas Consumption    | R2, MSE, MAE               |
| Linear Regression                    | Temperature, Gas Consumption    | R2, MSE, MAE               |
| Simple NN based non-linear regression | Temperature, Gas Consumption    | R2, MSE, MAE               |

## Plots

The `Plots` folder contains visualizations generated by the machine learning models. These plots compare the predictions of the ensemble, classical, and deep machine learning techniques, using R2, MSE, and MAE as evaluation parameters.
